"""Quote loading, and what happens when the quote file cannot be trusted.

The service is deliberately unkillable: a missing, malformed or wrongly shaped
quotes file must degrade to the built-in fallback rather than take the API
down, because a joke endpoint returning a 500 is worse than a joke endpoint
repeating itself.
